                        <p>Brown algae in fish tank environments seem to be one of the biggest problems of fishkeeping. <br>
                            Brown algae can quickly cover a beautiful tank, covering not just the view, but also the leaves 
                            of the plants in the tank, causing them to wilt and die.
                        </p>
                        <p>If not taken care of, brown algae becomes highly invasive due to its extreme tolerance to 
                            bad water conditions.
                        </p>    
                    </div>
                    <img src="../img/algae.png" alt="">    
                </div>
                <p>In fact, bad water conditions are often what makes brown algae thrive. Brown algae isn’t just a problem 
                    beginners face; more experienced aquarists also experience brown algae outbreaks, albeit much fewer than 
                    that of a beginner, and definitely much less severe.
                </p>
                <h2>THE DREADED DIATOM BLOOM</h2>
                <p>Brown algae is also known as diatoms that usually appear in new tanks, but can also appear in 
                    more established ones. <br>
                    In and of itself, diatoms aren’t harmless; they’re simply algae that feed off of the excess 
                    nutrients in an aquarium.<br>
                    They feed off of silicates, phosphates, and nitrates, which is also what plants consume.<br>
                    A diatom bloom often happens as a result of sudden excess waste that the system wasn’t used 
                    to dealing with.
                </p>
                <div class="imgfix"><img src="../img/diatoms.jpg" alt="person cleaning the algae from the aquarium"></div> 
                <p>In new tanks, this could simply be due to the fact that the system just needs time to establish 
                    the necessary bacteria that breaks down waste.<br>
                    In more established tanks, this could be due to something rotting away undetected, or a rock 
                    leeching away phosphates and other nasty stuff for diatoms to feed on.<br>
                    Unfiltered tap water can exacerbate this problem, as tap water often contains a high amount 
                    of silicate.
                </p>
                <h2>THE MAIN CULPRITS OF BROWN ALGAE IN FISH TANK ENVIRONMENTS</h2>
                <p>The biggest cause of brown algae outbreaks is often silicate. <br>
                    It can make its way into the tank of the unsuspecting aquarist via low quality salt mixes, unfiltered 
                    tap water, additives, and even substrates!<br>
                    Even the most diligent algae eaters will have a hard time ridding your tank of brown algae if the level 
                    of silicates isn’t drastically reduced. The diatoms will simply reappear in batches that your algae eaters 
                    cannot keep up with, and you’ll find yourself having to clean your aquarium glass, equipment, and plants 
                    often to keep your aquarium moss-free.
                </p>
                <p>The second biggest cause of brown algae outbreaks is excess nitrate levels. Beneficial bacteria that break 
                    down waste in the aquarium are able to convert the highly toxic ammonia to a less toxic nitrite, then from 
                    toxic nitrite to the least toxic nitrate.<br>
                    Unfortunately, however, the bacteria that can convert nitrate to hydrogen sulfide gas needs an anaerobic 
                    environment, which is difficult to produce in most aquariums without specialized, expensive equipment.<br>
                    Plants are able to remove some nitrates, but in tanks that are sparsely planted, nitrate levels can rise 
                    if water changes aren’t consistently performed.
                </p>
                <h2>GETTING RID OF THE BROWN ALGAE FOR GOOD</h2>
                <p>While there are many other factors that could cause the bloom of brown algae, the solutions to keeping 
                    them away for good are deceptively simple:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep your tank properly stocked</li>
                    <li>Maintain good aquarium husbandry</li>
                    <li>Buy the right aquarium equipment</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can think of this as the three golden rules of aquarium fishkeeping. Let’s go into more detail 
                    for these three rules:
                </p>
                <h3>RULE #1: KEEP YOUR TANK PROPERLY STOCKED</h3>
                <p>
                    Unlike lakes or oceans, aquariums have much less volume of water to dilute waste.<br>
                    The smaller your aquarium is, the more easily waste accumulates. That being said, it’s important to 
                    keep your stocking levels to a minimum if you plan on performing minimal water changes.<br>
                    This is especially important for saltwater aquariums, as there’s generally less dissolved oxygen in 
                    saltwater, and therefore can house much less fish than one might think.<br>
                    A 29 gallon saltwater tank, for instance, would often house only 3-5 fish.<br>
                    A 29 gallon freshwater tank, on the other hand, can have as much as 35 fish!<br>
                    If you plan on stocking your tank beyond its limits, be prepared to purchase additional filter media 
                    for the added waste, as well as more advanced equipment like algae turf scrubbers, and more frequent 
                    water changes.<br>
                    If you’re not prepared for the additional expense and work, stock sparsely.
                </p>
                <h3>RULE #2: MAINTAIN GOOD AQUARIUM HUSBANDRY</h3>
                <p>Brown algae in fish tank environments are catalyzed by poor aquarium husbandry.<br>
                    A lot of aquarists, especially the beginners, end up skipping routine water changes, therefore causing 
                    a buildup of silicates, nitrates, and phosphates.<br>
                    For saltwater tanks, this becomes especially problematic, as excess nutrient levels can actually kill 
                    off more sensitive invertebrates like coral and shrimp.<br>
                    For planted tanks, while this may pose less of a problem, it could very well hinder the growth of both 
                    plants and fish.<br>
                    For properly stocked tanks, a 20% weekly water change is sufficient, especially for smaller tanks.<br>
                    For larger tanks, a 20% biweekly water change will be enough. Lightly stocked saltwater tanks with protein 
                    skimmers can get away with as little as 20% monthly water changes.<br>
                    This water change includes replacing filter floss (if any), removing detritus from the substrate, and 
                    wiping off the brown algae you can remove.<br>
                    For sudden diatom blooms, you can perform a 50% water change daily for up to three days.<br>
                    For saltwater tanks, avoid tap water at all costs.<br>
                    For planted freshwater tanks, dechlorinated tap water is often acceptable.
                </p>
                <h3>RULE #3: BUY THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT</h3>
                <p>High quality aquarium equipment can save you a lot of time, as you do not need to perform too 
                    frequent water changes.<br>
                    In the long run, high quality equipment is also cheaper, as cheaper equipment tends to cause problems, 
                    especially with stray voltages electrifying tank inhabitants in saltwater aquariums.<br>
                    That being said, make sure you buy the right necessities for your tank; the light and filter.
                </p>
                <p><strong>AQUARIUM LIGHTING</strong><br>
                    For the light, reef aquariums do best with LED lights that can either have a basic mix of royal 
                    blues and 10,000k whites, or full spectrum. For planted tanks, a 6,700k or 10,000k LED will often 
                    suffice. The intensity, of course, will depend on the plants or corals you intend to keep.
                </p>
                <p> <strong>AQUARIUM FILTER</strong><br>
                    For the filter, planted tanks can get away with a good tank filter choice overhead filters, 
                    canister filters, hang-on-back filters (HOB), or even sponge filters. <br>
                    For saltwater tanks, hang-on-back filters are often advisable, along with a protein skimmer.
                </p>
                <p>The key here is to be able to provide sufficient flow for the kind of inhabitants you want to 
                    keep, while providing the necessary mechanical, biological, and chemical filtration with the 
                    filter media you buy.
                </p>
                <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
                <p>Unfortunately, even with regular aquarium maintenance and upkeep, algae blooms can still happen 
                    due to sudden die-offs and other unexpected circumstances like heatwaves. <br>
                    By knowing what parts of your tank can go haywire and what aspects of your tank you should keep 
                    your eye on, it becomes relatively simple to keep brown algae away most of the time.
                </p>
                <p>Brown algae in fish tank environments often go away when they’re starved of their basic necessities 
                    like silicates and nitrates, so stock the right fish, maintain good aquarium husbandry, and buy 
                    the right equipment, and you’ll keep your tank algae-free in years to come.
