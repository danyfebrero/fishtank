                        <p>Whether you’re setting up an aquarium for the first time, or moving an existing tank into a new home
                        or apartment, it’s a good idea to put some thought into where to place your fish tank. While there 
                        may be several open spaces in your home, apartment, or office to choose from, not all of them may 
                        be suitable for your aquarium.
                        </p>
                        <p>If you're looking for some help deciding where to put your fish tank, this step-by-step guide will 
                        lead you through the process of choosing the best location for your new aquarium.
                        </p>    
                    </div>

                </div>
                <h2> AQUARIUM SIZE MATTERS</h2>
                <p>This may seem obvious, but the size of your aquarium will play a big role in deciding where to place it. 
                    And we're not just talking about whether or not you have a space big enough to fit the physical dimensions 
                    of your tank. Size also plays a big role in the weight of your tank. The larger the aquarium, the more 
                    water it will hold, which can translate into a lot more weight! Weight is a very important consideration 
                    is deciding where to place your fish tank.
                </p>
                <p>Nano and desk-top aquariums are very popular. They don’t take up much room and are perfect for apartments, 
                    office tables and kid’s bedrooms. These tanks can be only a few gallons up to about 20-gallons. But did 
                    you know that a gallon of water weighs almost nine pounds?
                </p>
                <p>That means a five-gallon desk-top aquarium will weigh over 45 pounds! And a twenty-gallon aquarium will 
                    weigh close to 200 pounds when it's full of water, gravel and ornaments! You will need to find a location 
                    that can fit the dimensions of your tank but also its weight.
                </p>
                <div class="colored-background">
                    <p>The first priority is determining if it’s safe to place your aquarium on that table, shelf or counter.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Kit furniture from places like Ikea is usually of pressboard, which is fine and it may look nice, but it is 
                    generally not designed to support heavy loads. It may support your aquarium at first, but over time the 
                    particle-board components can weaken and break. Simple tasks like cleaning the aquarium glass or changing 
                    water puts even more shifting forces on the “soft” wood particles and can be a recipe for disaster.
                </p>
                <p>Another potential trouble spot is a child’s dresser or chest of drawers. A dresser can support a small 
                    aquarium but the extra weight could make the dresser top heavy. If you add in a curious child climbing 
                    on an open drawer, it could easily cause the dresser to fall forward due to the weight imbalance.
                </p>
                <p>The best option to support your fish tank is a purpose-built fish tank table. These tables are 
                    specifically built to support the weight of an aquarium. They often also have storage compartments for 
                    your fish tank equipment.
                </p>
                <p>However, even with a specialty fish tank table, your home’s floor must also be strong enough to support the 
                    weight of your aquarium. This is especially true with large, heavy aquariums. Some floors are also uneven, 
                    which can cause the stand and aquarium to twist under its own weight. This will force the silicon seams to 
                    pull away from the glass, causing a catastrophic leak. If the floor is uneven, level the aquarium stand 
                    before placing the aquarium on top. Never level the aquarium by placing shims under the tank, which can 
                    put undue stress on the glass.
                </p>
                <p>The bottom line is to make sure that your aquarium is in a location that can handle the weight and is placed
                     on top of a purpose-built aquarium table that is designed to support the weight of a heavy aquarium. 
                </p>
                <h2>AVOID AREAS SUBJECT TO EXTREME HOT AND COLD</h2>
                <p>Water temperature directly affects the biological processes of all aquatic life. This includes fish, plants, 
                    snails and even the bacteria that help keep the tank clean and healthy. Your tank’s aquatic life thrives 
                    when the water temperature remains stable. Areas that are subject to extreme fluctuations in temperature 
                    are not ideal locations for your aquarium.</p>
                <p>While an aquarium heater will increase the water temperature if the room temperature is a few degrees below 
                    the optimal temperature, it can’t compensate for extreme cold. If your aquarium is placed near an air 
                    conditioner or HVAC duct, it may get a direct shot of cold air. A lot depends on the type of cooling system 
                    and temperature dynamics in the room. While moddern HVAC systems are designed to “gently cool” the room 
                    without sending out a blast of frigid air, older air conditioning systems may not be so friendly and could 
                    rapidly chill the area around the vent. The same applies for heating. The area around a freestanding wood 
                    stove is not ideal for an aquarium.
                </p>
                <p>In the “old days” aquarists were told to never to put an aquarium near a window. The logic was the sunlight 
                    would overheat the water and thus placing an aquarium directly in front of a brightly lit window “could” 
                    cause a temperature increase. However, in today’s climate controlled homes and offices this is pretty 
                    unlikely. You can find aquariums installed in aquarium shop windows, glass-enclosed car dealerships and 
                    exotic tropical hotels. The best advice is to take the time to check out potential locations and see if 
                    they are subject to temperature extremes.
                </p>
                <h2>ELECTRICAL SAFETY AND AQUARIUMS</h2>
                <p>
                    Aquariums need electric power for the filter, heater, and lighting. That means your fish tank will likely 
                    need a minimum of three electrical sockets. For most desktop tanks and tropical aquariums this is all 
                    you’ll need to power the tank. Your standard 15-amp household outlet with a high-quality power strip will 
                    easily provide the necessary electricity for your aquarium.
                </p>
                <p>However, you should make sure to mount the power strip off the floor and away from potential water splashes 
                    to prevent electrocution and/or short circuits. You should also make sure all the power cords are configured 
                    in a drip loop. This will prevent water from running down the power cord and into the electrical outlet. 
                    This simple safety precaution should not be ignored.
                </p>
                <p>If you’re setting up a reef aquarium the power requirements are even greater. You will need a power supply 
                    capable of handling one or more return pumps, wave makers, protein skimmer and reef lighting.
                </p>
                <p>If you're building an automated aquarium you’ll probably need to run a wireless hub or controller to 
                    synchronize all the hardware. Dosing pumps and remote sensors will also need a power supply. You may even 
                    be running a chiller to keep the reef water cool.
                </p>
                <p>For more complicated aquarium systems it is best to “map out” the power requirements and assemble a safe 
                    power strip configuration that is not overloaded. Saltwater “creep” always seems to find electrical outlets 
                    so be sure to keep outlets and plugs free of salt crust. Crusty outlets can arc and start a fire!
                </p>
                <h2>IS THERE A FRESHWATER SUPPLY SOURCE NEARBY?</h2>
                <p>Like electricity, you’ll need fresh water to regularly fill, clean, and top-off your aquarium. The closer 
                    you can locate your aquarium to a fresh water source the less water carrying you'll have to do. And, as 
                    we've discuss, water is heavy so carrying it isn't very fun!
                </p>
                <p>Aquariums lose water through evaporation. This is especially true in the warm summer season or if the 
                    aquarium is in a low-humidity environment or climate controlled home or office.
                </p>
                <p>You’ll obviously need water to fill up the aquarium when you set it up. But that’s not all. The aquarium 
                    will “drink” quite a bit of water every week. It will need weekly top-offs. Some reef aquariums even 
                    need even daily top-offs to compensate for water loss due to protein skimming and evaporation.
                </p>
                <p>Topping off your tank, as well as your regular water changes, will go much smoother if you have a water 
                    source close by. Ideally you should be able to blend hot and cold water to match the aquarium water 
                    temperature.
                </p>
                <p>In office buildings a janitor’s mop room will often have hot and cold water. However, carrying a bucket 
                    of water from the basement or other side of the office can become tedious. If distance is unavoidable, 
                    a small cart for transporting a bucket of water can make things much easier! You can even run a hose 
                    from the water source to the tank, using a ready-made aquarium hose kit.
                </p>
                <h2>IS THERE A WATER DISPOSAL SOURCE NEARBY?</h2>
                <p>It may seem ironic but once you fill your aquarium with water you’ll also be taking water out of it.</p>
                <p>Water changes are one of the most effective ways of keeping your fish tank's water clean and clear. 
                    Water changes need to be done every 2-4 weeks. This involves removing water and replacing it with 
                    new freshwater or artificial seawater. The filter and ornaments will also occasionally need to be 
                    removed from the aquarium and scrubbed clean.
                </p>
                <p>A kitchen or laundry room sink are ideal places to work. Though, you may want to keep in mind that 
                    some of your family members or co-workers may not appreciate “fish water” being near dishware and 
                    food preparation. Cleaning up afterwards and off-hours maintenance can help solve these objections. 
                    Dirty aquarium water can also be poured into the toilet and flushed away. A janitor’s room often has 
                    a mop bucket dump station, making water disposal easy.
                </p>
                <h2>AVOID HIGH TRAFFIC AREAS</h2>
                <p>Since aquariums are made of glass or acrylic, they can become scratched or chipped by a variety of 
                    common objects like vacuum cleaners, brooms, toys, and just about anything solid. Aquarium stands 
                    can also be damaged by objects that rub against the finish. Aquariums and fish tanks, especially 
                    smaller ones, can also be accidentally knocked over.
                </p>
                <p>When choosing a location for your aquarium, think about who and what travels near the area. This is 
                    especially important in a public or business location when people and materials may frequently pass 
                    by your aquarium.
                </p>
                <p>In your home it might not be a good idea to place the aquarium next to a busy hallway, for instance. 
                    Entrance doors are also not a great location as people often come in with arms full of bags, packages, 
                    and household supplies that can make it easy to bump into the aquarium.
                </p>
                <p>Bottom line, make sure there is plenty of open space around your aquarium to avoid bumps, scrapes and 
                    difficulty moving past the tank.
                </p>
                <h2>CHOOSE THE BEST VIEWING LOCATION</h2>
                <p>It may seem strange what we put choosing the best viewing location at the end of our list on deciding 
                    where to place a fish tank. However, the reason is because the best viewing location may not be the 
                    best spot for the aquarium. Some items on this checklist, like electrical safety, can’t be compromised! 
                    Other categories are going to be a trade-off between what's ideal vs what's practical.
                </p>
                <p>Obviously one of the reasons we all have aquariums is to look at them. However, not everyone agrees on 
                    what the best viewing location is. For some, a darkened room is the most desirable for viewing a reef 
                    aquarium. While other people may like a more prominent location in the family room or office that can 
                    be seen by more people.
                </p>
                <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
                <p>Since no two aquariums are the same, only you can decide on the best location for your tank. Follow 
                    the 7 steps above and you will be well on your way to determining where to place a fish tank in your 
                    home or office.
