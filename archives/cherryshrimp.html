                <p>Cherry Shrimp, Neocaridina denticulata sinensis, are one of the most popular freshwater shrimp in the 
                    aquarium hobby alongside the ghost shrimp and the amano shrimp. Cherry Shrimp are known for their 
                    small size and bright red color. They can live up to two years in an aquarium and are simple to take 
                    care of. Cherry Shrimp care requires following just a few simple steps to keep your shrimp happy 
                    and healthy.

                <img src="../img/cs.jpg" alt="primary colors of cherry shrimp">
                <p>Follow this guide and soon you will be enjoying the beauty and interesting behavior of your very own 
                    Cherry Shrimp aquarium.</p>
                <h2>CHERRY SHRIMP COLOR</h2>
                <p>In nature, shrimp have a greenish-brown color. This is great for hiding from hungry predators. However, 
                    through selective breeding, brightly colored variations have been created for aquarium lovers to enjoy. 
                    This includes the Red Cherry Shrimp. These shrimp get these colors from something called chromatophores, 
                    which is when the cells on an animal's surface contain pigments. These pigmented cells give shrimp their 
                    bright coloration.</p>
                <p>These color types and corresponding chromatophores include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Yellow</strong> - The yellow color is caused by xanthophores.</li>
                    <li><strong>White</strong> - White coloration is caused by leucophores.</li>
                    <li><strong>Blue</strong> - Iridophores reflect blue light.</li>
                    <li><strong>Red</strong> - The red color is caused by erythrophores.</li>
                    <li><strong>Violet</strong> - Violet is a mixture of iridophores (blue) and erythrophores (red).</li>
                    <li><strong>Black</strong> - Melanophores are black.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chocolate</strong> - Brownish melanophores. Additional erythrophores (red) or xanthophores (yellow) can add to the brown coloration.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clear</strong> - No color due to lack of chromataphores.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>CHERRY SHRIMP AQUARIUM NEEDS</h2>
                <p>An important thing to understand about Cherry Shrimp keeping is that these tiny shrimp are incompatible with 
                    nearly all freshwater fish. In nature, many fish eat shrimp and other crustaceans. As a result, their brains 
                    are programmed to bite, nip, crunch and swallow anything that looks shrimp like. Even if the shrimp is the 
                    same size as the fish, the fish will constantly poke and chase it.
                </p>
                <p>Now add in their bright coloration and Cherry Shrimp are like a flashing sign that says, “Eat me, I’m tasty!” 
                    This is why successful shrimp keepers prefer to set up a dedicated shrimp tank. It allows the shrimp to feel 
                    safe and explore the aquarium without having to hide from predators.
                </p>
                <p>We’ve covered how to set up a shrimp aquarium in detail in another article. But here is a short list of items 
                    you’ll need to provide a suitable environment for Cherry Shrimp.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An aquarium in the 3 to 10 gallon range is ideal for Cherry shrimp. A larger aquarium is not essential 
                        but it does allow for more complex aquascaping with plants, rocks, logs and other items.
                    </li>
                    <li>LED light fixture that highlights the shrimp’s beautiful coloration. Lighting is essential for keeping 
                        live plants too. LED lighting is much cooler than traditional aquarium lighting and uses very little 
                        energy.
                    </li>
                    <li>Aquarium heater to stabilize the water temperature and prevent fluctuations</li>
                    <li>A small filter that does not create a lot of turbulence in the tank. Cherry shrimp don’t like to be 
                        “blasted” with strong water flow.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Cherry Shrimp also like places to explore and things to climb on. Create structure with aquarium-safe rocks 
                    and drift wood. Specialty shrimp caves and homes are also available on Amazon. Cherry Shrimp really like to 
                    climb on aquatic plants as well. As an added benefit, live plants also look great and act as a natural 
                    filtration systems that reduce nutrients that stimulate algae growth. If you don’t want live plants, there 
                    are plenty of silk or plastic aquarium plants on Amazon that you can use.
                </p>
                <p>Experienced shrimp keepers claim that shrimps' colors will lighten if the gravel in the tank is lighter in 
                    color. Consider a brown or black substrate to keep your shrimps' colors bright and vivid.
                </p>
                <h2>CHERRY SHRIMP AND WATER QUALITY</h2>
                <p>Cherry shrimp are not picky about water parameters but they don’t like fluctuations in temperature and water 
                    chemistry. Dechlorinated tap water works well with Cherry shrimp provided that the pH is between 6.0 and 
                    7.6. pH should be adjusted if it is out of this range. Water hardness is not critical but should remain 
                    stable. When making water changes, make sure there are no dramatic changes in pH or hardness.
                </p>
                <p>Shrimp thrive in a wide variety of temperature ranges. The aquarium can be kept at 65-80°F. But wild 
                    temperature swings must be avoided. A submersible aquarium heater will prevent low-temperature shock. 
                    Also, when topping off or making water changes, let the water warm up to avoid rapid temperature 
                    swings.
                </p>
                <h2>A WORD ABOUT COPPER</h2>
                <p>Cherry shrimp are very sensitive to copper. In trace amounts copper is an essential element in their diet.
                     Shrimp blood even uses copper to carry oxygen, which gives shrimp blood its blue color. But too much 
                     copper can kill shrimp. Tap water in homes can contain high levels of copper from copper piping. If you 
                     see blue or green stains in the sink, toilet or bath tub, you’ve got copper in the water supply.
                    </p>
                <p>If your tap water has high levels of copper, consider using “spring” or “filtered” water in your shrimp 
                    aquarium. Avoid distilled or reverse osmosis water. These types of highly purified water contain no minerals 
                    or pH stabilizing carbonates. Spring and filtered water typically contain a variety of minerals but no harmful 
                    copper or other metals that can harm shrimp.
                </p>
                <p>Some water conditioners contain a metal detoxifying chemical but they may not be strong enough to render all of 
                    the copper harmless to the shrimp.
                </p>

                <h2>CHERRY SHRIMP AND WATER CHANGES</h2>
                <p>If you’re new to aquarium keeping, you may not understand why water changes are necessary. Aquariums are 
                    “closed aquatic systems.” Tropical streams are constantly flushed with water from springs, upstream 
                    tributaries and rain. However, aquariums have no natural flushing system. The only way for new, clean 
                    water to get into the tank is through a partial water change.
                </p>
                <p>Over time, aquarium water changes for the worse. Natural organic substances from the breakdown of algae, 
                    plants, fish waste and prepared food builds up in the water. This causes a tea like discoloration that 
                    reduces light penetration. Research has proven that aquariums with a high level of organic waste also 
                    have more problems with disease and poor health. While aquarium filters help, water changes are essential 
                    for replenishing minerals while reducing excess salts and waste materials.
                </p>
                <p>Algae promoting phosphate and nitrate also increase over time. Partial water changes dilute these nutrients 
                    and lower the chances of algae growth on the rocks, gravel and aquarium glass.
                </p>
                <p>Changing 10% of the water every week or 20% every two weeks is recommended.</p>
                <p>Use a siphon tube or gravel cleaner to remove old water and particles of debris. Be careful not to suck up a 
                    curious shrimp. They love to explore new things in their tank, even a suction tube! When replacing the water, 
                    make sure it is about the same temperature as the remaining aquarium water.
                </p>
                <h2>FEEDING CHERRY SHRIMP</h2>
                <p>Cherry Shrimp are omnivores, meaning they eat both plant and animal-based diets. This makes the feeding aspect 
                    of shrimp keeping very easy. The natural food for shrimp is live algae and biofilm. Biofilm is a combination 
                    of microscopic bacteria, algae cells and other tiny life forms invisible to our eyes.
                </p>
                <p>Shrimp forage for this live food as they explore the aquarium. Shrimp will climb on the aquarium glass, plants 
                    and driftwood, scraping away biofilm and live algae. As a result, there is no need to maintain a “spotless” 
                    algae-free shrimp aquarium because it provides a healthy diet.
                </p>
                <p>Cherry Shrimp will eat any type of aquarium fish flake or pellet. Specialty shrimp pellets are also available. 
                    Some shrimp keepers also experiment with small bits of soft vegetables like zucchini. As a general rule, be 
                    careful never to let food particles decay in the aquarium.
                </p>
                <p>When feeding shrimp, you need to pay attention, especially during the first month of setting up a new shrimp 
                    aquarium. The biological filtration process can take up to 30 days to become fully active. Over feeding an 
                    aquarium can cause a surge in harmful ammonia and nitrite, which will stress or kill the shrimp. Aquarium 
                    test kits are available to monitor these parameters.
                </p>
                <p>Java moss is a welcome food source for Cherry Shrimp. This moss provides habitat for microscopic live foods 
                    to grow. The shrimp will explore and “harvest” the food that inhabits the java moss.
                </p>
                <p>As shrimp grow, they shed their exoskeleton. Many shrimp keepers leave the clear skeleton in the tank. Shrimp 
                    will eat it, recycling the minerals contained in the clear skeleton.
                </p>
                <h2>CHERRY SHRIMP TANKMATES</h2>
                <p>It may seem like a cool idea to mix different colored shrimp together in the same aquarium. However, this will 
                    not work over the long-term. Neocaridina species will crossbreed. This means their offspring eventually 
                    revert to the dull greenish brown wild type. If you keep only one color type, they will continue to breed 
                    and maintain the population in the aquarium.
                </p>
                <p>For added variety you can mix Red Crystal Shrimp and Bee Shrimp (Caridina) with Neocaridina species. 
                    Indonesian “gold rabbit” snails are shrimp safe and help keep the tank clean. Freshwater clams and Nerita 
                    snails are also interesting tank-mates for Cherry Shrimp.
                </p>
                <h2>BREEDING CHERRY SHRIMP</h2>
                <p>Freshwater shrimp won’t be able to breed until they are 4–6 months old. Breeding shrimp is not difficult once 
                    they are sexually mature. Keeping five or six shrimp should result in at least one breeding pair.
                </p>
                <p>Signs of developing eggs appear as a greenish yellow "saddle" pattern on the female’s back. She will molt when 
                    the eggs are ready for fertilization by the male shrimp. The female releases pheromones into the water to 
                    attract male shrimp.
                </p>
                <p>When males detect the mating chemical they will actively search for the female. When he finds the female he 
                    will climb onto her and deposit sperm. But the eggs are not actually fertilized. Only when she lays her 
                    20-30 eggs, attaching them under her body, are they fertilized by the male’s sperm. Once the female is 
                    carrying eggs, breeders say she is "berried".
                </p>
                <p>Healthy, fertilized eggs turn darker as they develop toward hatching. After about three weeks the eggs hatch. 
                    The baby shrimp are very small but fully developed. They will immediately begin feeding on biofilm. Eventually
                     they will grow to the adult size and begin mating as well.
                </p>
                <p>First time breeding sometimes fails. This could be due to immaturity, inexperience, stress, or poor water 
                    conditions. Since shrimp have a relatively short lifespan, breeding replenishes the population in your 
                    aquarium.
                </p>
                <h2>FINAL THOUGHTS</h2>
                <p>Cherry Shrimp are an easy and fun addition to the aquarium hobby. You don’t need to invest in a large 
                    aquarium to enjoy their vibrant red beauty and active antics. If you follow this guide and you’ll be on 
                    the way to big fun with tiny Cherry Shrimp!
