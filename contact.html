        <p>We accept guest posts on topics related to fish keeping, aquariums, and other 
            related topics for our audience. This includes how-to guides, product 
            comparisons, etc.
        </p><br>
        <h3>Content:</h3><br>
        <p>The content MUST be interesting, unique, and original. No rehashed content or

        audience.
        </p><br>
        <h3>Word count:</h3><br>
        <p>The word count must be in 1,500 to 3,500 words. Again, we are looking for 
            in-depth high-quality content, which usually means something within this 
            range.
        </p><br>
        <h3>Outbound Links:</h3> 
        <p>You may add 1 link to your blog or website as long as it is relevant to the 
            topic discussed. You should also include at least 3-5 links to external 
            resources relevant with the topic. These links should be meant to provide 
            additional information and / or support statements by referring to 
            authoritative resources. We reserve the right to reject or request changes 
            to links and/or anchor text. All links should open in a new page.
