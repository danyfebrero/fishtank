# Hello folk! 
This is my first project in Code Louisville Front End Web Development. The project is a website about fish keeping and should meet some requirements.

## Basic Requirements:
- Designed with “mobile first” principles.
- 2 media queries that create a better layout/user experience. one breakpoint at (min-width: 589px) and another at (min-width: 992px).
- I uploaded the prpject to my GitHub repository using bash at least 13 times.

## CSS Requirements:
- I made a navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon. I located the burger menu on the bottom of the screen for easily access when using mobile and tablets. I made part of this using JS.
- Used Flexbox and CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. Mostly used CSS Grid to make the layout and Flexbox to justify and align the elements inside of the grid.
- Used “:nth-child” to select some elements and make then to slide.
- I did CSS animation on the menu burger changin and traslating the span element, and moving the pictures of the image slider.
## JS Requirements:
- I created a JavaScript function that performs some form of mathematical operation to calulate the dimensions of the images of the slider to stack all of then side by side and make the slide efect.
- I did a JavaScript array to hold and track the slides in the carousel so I can move back and forward.
- Show/hide the nav menu when clicking the icon.
